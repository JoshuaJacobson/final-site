			<h2 id="NewsTitle">Off Season Competition</h2>
			<h5 id="NewsInfo">10-16-2016</h5>
			<p id="NewsText">
				  Yesterday the team had an opportunity to attend the Pellston Off-Season competition. Throughout the day, we played 6 qualifying matches and won 5, seeding us as the third place team for the day. During the semi-finals, we were an alliance captain that won one of the three matches.
				<br><br>
				  Overall the competition was a great success, as we were able to give our rookies a chance to drive the robot and see for themselves what a competition is like.
				<br><br>
				  As we look forward to the kickoff of FIRST Steamworks in January of 2017, we also look for new sponsors so we can order our kit of parts to build our robots. Remember, if you our your business would like to sponsor the cadillac connectors, please email <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=frcteam5086@gmail.com&amp;su=Sponsorship%20Opportunity" target="_blank">frcteam5086@gmail.com</a><br>

			<h5 id="NewsInfo">4-19-2016</h5>
			<p id="NewsText">
				TC Competition was a huge success! We made it all the way to semi-finals and beat out many larger teams, 
				and lost only to the team predicted to win it all and destroy all competition by only a few points. In the 
				words of Captain Alex Irwin, 
				<i>"I'm proud of the team for solving the issues we faced in Howell. 
				I'm also glad that I got to experience being an alliance captain and proud 
				that we made it so far in competition."</i> 
				I guess it's all proof that "if at first you don't succeed (Howell) then try, try, again.

			<h2 id="NewsTitle">Howell Competition Update!</h2>
			<h5 id="NewsInfo">4-06-2016</h5>
			<p id="NewsText">
				Our FIRST competition is over! We had quite a few good games, and a few little mishaps. Overall we feel 
				that we preformed well, coming in at 28<sup>th</sup> out of 40 teams, many of whom had more years of expirience 
				than we did. After a week of tweaks and adjustments, we think we are ready to go to TC and be the best we 
				can be! Long-time mentor Jim Jakubos said, <i>"The robot functioned as inteded, we had a few electrical and programming errors, but those have been 
				fixed, and we are ready for our next competition"</i>.
				<br>We made the following changes/improvements to our bot:
				</p><ul style="text-align:left">
					<li>We can now shoot high goals</li>
					<li>We secured the wiring so that it will cause less issues</li>
					<li>We added another autonomous program to deal with the moat</li>
				</ul>
				We have some videos on our homepage where you can see our robot in action.
				<br>

			<h5 id="NewsInfo">2-09-2016</h5>
			<p id="NewsText">
				Apologies for the giant lack of progress updates and news. As we have gotten closer to bag and tag day, 
				more and more information has been confidential. However, now that we are really close to bag and tag, 
				we feel that it would be okay to release more info in interest of our supporters and team friends. So, 
				in bulk, we have done a lot in terms of progress. As of me writing this, we have assembled the chassis, 
				and tested our ball intake and firing systems extensively. We have also started to secure components on 
				our electronics plate. Teleoperated Code is completed in Java, and we are on the verge of creating a few 
				autonomous programs. Below are some of the photos of the last few weeks.

				Today we deployed our first code to the robot, to test the spinning of the treads. 
				At first one spun much faster than the other, but then we fine tuned them to be in sync. 
				Tomorrow we plan on adding turning and a ball infeed.

			<h5 id="NewsInfo">1-22-2016</h5>
			<p id="NewsText">
				Today we headed over to Rexair to test the abilities of motors firing a ball. With our previous design, 
				we were on a 10 : 1 gearbox, and the ball shot out about as fast as a horse drawn carriage walking 
				through a molasses <b>moat.</b> So, purely to test the revolutions needed, we created a chute for the 
				ball to travel out of cardboard, gutted the inside of some vacuums, and spun them up to 6,000 RPM. As 
				you can see In the video, the ball definitely shoots.

				Today we worked a lot on building defences. We finished our rough terrain, and started work on the moat. 
				We are currently waiting for the tank treads to come in, then we will start work on the Robot. Some of 
				us worked on CAD designs or coding. Overall, we would like to have 2-3 more defences done tomorrow.
